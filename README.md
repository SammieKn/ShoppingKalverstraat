# A data visualization project of traffic in amsterdam

Website: https://data.amsterdam.nl/data/datasets/PnrmHN-YvSqjhw/langzaam-verkeer-monitoringsysteem-amsterdam-lvma/
API: https://api.data.amsterdam.nl/v1/crowdmonitor/passanten/
Documentation: https://api.data.amsterdam.nl/v1/docs/datasets/crowdmonitor.html#passanten
Map with sensors: https://maps.amsterdam.nl/lvma/

An interesting study would be to check the correlation between bad weather and traffic intensity.

What do the sensors messure:
1. Direction of travel
2. Density of traffic (per m2 in measuring area)
3. Modality (cycling or walking)
4. Countline
5. Speed

Types of sensors:
2D videoanalysis: These are camera's (2d). Based on these camera's, count speed etc. is calculated.

## Goal of the project
The goal of the project is to do a data visualization and analysis project for my portfolio and as a hobby. 
To achieve this goal, I have set up the following questions that I want to answer with the data:
1. What is the busiest time of day for the sensor? (Working days and weekend)
2. How does the volume of bicycle traffic vary during different times of the day across key locations in Amsteradm?
3. What are the effects of seasonal variations on bicycle traffic in Amsterdam?
4. Which bicycle lanes require widening?
5. Can seasonal variations be used to make predictions about the traffic intensity on a certain day?

## What I would like to learn from the project
1. Making calls to an API
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Nice looking Data Visualization using Python
4. Using statistics to test the effects of weather on traffic

## Steps in the project
1. Write a script to make calls to a REST API
2. Download the required data from the API for the different questions
3. Explore the data
4. Visualize the data
